//! # **Statistical Distributions Module** - *Comprehensive Probability Distribution Computing*
//!
//! Advanced statistical distribution kernels providing high-performance probability density
//! functions (PDFs), cumulative distribution functions (CDFs), quantile functions, and
//! random sampling with SIMD acceleration and numerical precision guarantees.
//!
//! ## Distribution Categories
//! - **Univariate distributions**: Complete coverage of common continuous and discrete distributions
//! - **Multivariate distributions**: Multivariate normal, Student-t, Wishart, and advanced distributions
//! - **Parametric families**: Beta, gamma, normal, exponential, and related distribution families  
//! - **Discrete distributions**: Binomial, Poisson, geometric, and hypergeometric variants
//!
//! ## Core Statistical Functions  
//! Each distribution provides a complete statistical interface:
//! - **Probability density/mass functions**: Optimised PDF/PMF evaluation with numerical stability
//! - **Cumulative distribution functions**: CDF computation with extended precision algorithms
//! - **Quantile functions**: Inverse CDF calculation using robust bracketing and refinement
//! - **Random sampling**: High-quality pseudorandom generation with distributional correctness
//!
//! ## Computational Architecture
//! Distribution calculations employ sophisticated numerical techniques for accuracy and performance:
//! - **SIMD vectorisation**: Hardware-accelerated evaluation of distribution functions
//! - **Rational approximations**: Optimised polynomial and rational function approximations
//! - **Series expansions**: Convergent series with adaptive truncation for transcendental functions
//! - **Numerical integration**: Gauss-Kronrod quadrature for complex distribution functions
//!
//! ## Arrow Integration and Null Handling
//! The module integrates seamlessly with Apache Arrow's memory model and null semantics:
//! - **Null-aware processing**: Efficient handling of missing values with validity bitmasks
//! - **SIMD-accelerated masking**: Vectorised null propagation without conditional branches
//! - **Arrow-compatible layouts**: Direct operation on Arrow array structures
//! - **Memory efficiency**: Zero-copy operations where mathematically valid
//!
//! ### Null Value Philosophy
//! Rather than assume, we choose to recognise inf and NaN as valid float values 
//! (consistent with Apache Arrow semantics), leaving it to the user to subsequently 
//! treat them as nulls if they wish, given that there are numerical scenarios where 
//! they represent information gain. This approach avoids computational overhead in
//! the hot path whilst preserving mathematical correctness for edge cases.
//!
//! ## Numerical Precision and Stability
//! All distribution implementations prioritise numerical accuracy across parameter ranges.
//! See `./tests` for any specific tolerance requirements, where it is measured against Scipy.
//! Whilst these pass on the development machine, platform specific difference may impact your 
//! test results, and thus one should keep this in mind when evaluating this library's fit for your use case.
//!
//! ## Disclaimer
//! This implementation is provided on a best-effort basis and is intended for
//! general scientific and engineering use. While every attempt has been made to
//! match the accuracy and behaviour of established libraries such as SciPy, we
//! make no guarantees as to correctness, fitness for any particular purpose, or
//! suitability for uses such as in life-critical, safety-critical, or financial applications.
//!
//! Results may differ from other libraries due to platform, compiler, or implementation
//! differences. Edge cases and special values are handled explicitly for compatibility
//! with SciPy (v1.16) but users are responsible for independently verifying that this
//! function meets their accuracy and reliability requirements.
//!
//! By using these functions, you accept all responsibility for outcomes or decisions
//! based upon its results.
